# FakeVideoDetection
With recent advances in computer vision and graphics, it is now
possible to generate videos with extremely realistic synthetic faces,
even in real time. Our paper checks the realism of the videos, what are
the parameters of detection fake videos, is high quality or low quality
videos need different approach. This paper model for detecting fake
or synthesis videos is generalize and can be trained for any type of
videos.
